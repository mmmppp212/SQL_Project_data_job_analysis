Answer: What are the most optimal skills to learn (aka it’s in high demand and a high-paying skill)?
- Identify skills in high demand and associated with high average salaries for Data Analyst roles
- Concentrates on remote positions with specified salaries
- Why? Targets skills that offer job security (high demand) and financial benefits (high salaries), 
    offering strategic insights for career development in data analysis

/*
- Highest salaries come from low-demand, engineering-heavy skills (Go, Hadoop, Snowflake).
- Cloud & data warehouse skills balance demand and pay (AWS, Azure, BigQuery).
- Core analyst skills dominate demand but pay less (Python, R, Tableau).
- BI tools are widely required but not premium-paid (Looker, Tableau).
- Takeaway: Salary peaks with infrastructure + analytics crossover, while pure analysis skills scale demand, not pay.
